                Sumitra travelled to the sacred lakes of Gosainkunda in November
                2020 and discovers how rejuvenating it is, and how quiet it is
                due to the pandemic. She also brings back valuable information
                on how best to trek during these times.

                Do you believe trekking is a perfect remedy to ease all those
                stress, boredom, anxiety you built up during lockdown period?
                Let me share, how I managed to pull off necessary travel
                refreshment for my mental health and unleashed my travelling
                spirits.

                The first thing I did was to look for a potential trekking spot
                that is not far from Kathmandu because staying in close contact
                with my family members was my top most priority.

                Second, I searched for few trekking routes opened for travel
                enthusiastic. So, I chose Gosaikunda trekking route which was of
                3 nights 4 days. Depending upon your walk and fitness level the
                travel period could be either shorter or longer.
